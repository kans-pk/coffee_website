        <h2>Coffee Tastes Better when it is <b>Strong!</b><br><b>Do you Agree?</b></h2>
        <div class="b2">
            <p>Coffee is a drink prepared from roasted coffee beans. Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It has the highest sales in the world market for hot drinks.

                Seeds of the Coffea plant's fruits are separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans. The beans are roasted and then ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee. It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Coffee can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk, and cream are often used to mask the bitter taste or enhance the flavor.</p>

        <h3>TYPES</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="hd2">
        <p class="hdd">Yes, there’s over 120 varieties of coffee plants and each produces a different type of coffee bean, however the majority of the coffee we consume comes from just two variants, Robusta (also known as Coffea Robusta or Coffea Canephora) or Arabica (Coffea Arabica) or a blend of the two. The two varieties differ in taste, growing conditions, and price.</p>
        <ul type="disk">
            <li>Type of Bean:
            </li>
            <p class="hdd">Coffee beans come from the coffee plant, a bush-like plant which can get very tall (coffee farmers will usually keep them trimmed to around 5ft to keep them manageable). On these coffee plants, bunches of cherries grow and it’s inside these that you’ll find two coffee beans.

                On average, it takes around one year for the coffee plant to begin to produce fragrant, white flowers, then up to four years later before it begins to bear fruit. However, it’ll be around 10 years for these plants to begin producing coffee beans on a commercial level, which are the ones of the most value to the farmers. The general lifespan of the coffee plant will be between 30 to 40 years but they can live much longer depending on the care given!</p></dd>
            <li>Type of Roast:</li>
            <p class="hdd">If you’ve ever felt overwhelmed in the grocery store coffee aisle, you’re not alone. City, French, Viennese, Cinnamon — there are hundreds of varieties of coffee and almost as many types of roasts!

                Though the bean itself matters, coffee gets a lot of its aroma and flavor from the roasting process. The length of the roasting process can affect many things, including the body, acidity, and flavor of your tasty beans. To help you expand your coffee knowledge, we’ve put together this handy guide to the four major types of coffee roasts.</p>
            <li>Type of Grind:</li>
            <p class="hdd">The grind size you use ultimately impacts the coffees taste once it comes into contact with water. How fine or how coarse the beans are ground affects how fast the water will pass through them, determining the strength of your coffee.If your beans are ground coarsely, the water will move quickly between the pieces, extracting only some of the flavour. To get a full balance of flavour, it’s best to brew these grounds for a bit longer so more of the flavour is extracted. That’s why, for example, a French Press can take four minutes to get the perfect brew.Finely ground beans mean the coffee grinds are, well, fine, and packed more closely. Water can take longer to pass through all the grounds and, as a result, extract more of the flavour. That’s why when you’re brewing an espresso, you only need a fraction of the time you’d use with a French Press to get the full flavour of your coffee.</p>
            <li>Decaffeinated Coffee:</li>
            <p class="hdd">There’s no such thing as decaf coffee beans as they naturally contain caffeine. The decaffeination process is carried out prior to roasting which involves swelling them with water or steam, then extracting the caffeine with water, organic solvent or activated carbon. Finally, the decaf coffee beans are dried to return them to their normal moisture.

                Despite being referred to as ‘decaffeinated’, decaf coffee beans will always contain some caffeine as it’s not possible to remove it all during the process.</p>
